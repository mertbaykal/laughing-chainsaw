# Alarm System Project

## Overview
This project simulates a simple alarm system with Event-Driven Programming (EDP). The system consists of 4 agents:
1. AlarmTrigger: Triggers the alarm at a specific time.
2. AlarmNotifier: Sends notifications when the alarm is triggered.
3. AlarmLogger: Logs the alarm event to a file.
4. AlarmReseter: Resets the alarm to prepare for the next trigger.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `src` folder.
3. Run the `main.py` file.
